## 📅 Weekly Progress Overview

### ✅ Week 1: Foundations & First Model

| Day | Topic | Highlights |
|-----|-------|------------|
| 1   | Project Setup | Python, GitHub repo, README, and basic environment |
| 2   | Load Data & Visualize | Loaded human vitals dataset, time-series plots |
| 3   | Clean Data & Engineering | Filled missing values, added noise, calculated BMI/MAP |
| 4   | EDA | Histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, correlation matrix |
| 5   | First ML Model | Trained RandomForestClassifier to predict Risk Category |
| 6   | Hyperparameter Tuning | Used GridSearchCV for better model performance |
| 7   | SHAP Explainability | Global feature importance via SHAP (wrapped RF model) |
