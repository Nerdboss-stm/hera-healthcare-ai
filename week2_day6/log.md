# Week 2 â€“ Day 6 Log

## âœ… Tasks Completed
- Performed hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Tried different combinations of n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_split
- Selected best model using 5-fold cross-validation
- Evaluated final model on test set
- Saved tuned model as `tuned_risk_model.pkl`

## ðŸ§  Learnings
- GridSearchCV automates hyperparameter optimization
- Cross-validation ensures generalization, not overfitting
- Best model config: `{fill after run}`
- Model now better at identifying risk with higher accuracy and recall

## ðŸ“… GitHub Activity
- Added: `tune_model.py`, tuned model, log file
- Commit: `"Tuned Random Forest model using GridSearchCV"`
