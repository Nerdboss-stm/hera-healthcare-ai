# Week 1 â€“ Day 3 Log

## âœ… Tasks Completed
- Handled missing values (mean for numerical, mode for categorical)
- Simulated real-world sensor noise on vital signs
- Calculated BMI, MAP, and Pulse Pressure manually
- Exported cleaned dataset

## ðŸ§  Learnings
- How to detect and treat missing values
- Basic clinical formulas for health feature engineering
- Importance of data quality in healthcare AI
- Simulating noise helps create realistic training scenarios

## ðŸ§ª Example Formulas Used
- BMI = weight / heightÂ²  
- MAP = (2 Ã— diastolic + systolic) / 3  
- Pulse Pressure = systolic - diastolic

## ðŸ“… GitHub Activity
- Added: `clean_features.py`, `cleaned_vitals.csv`, `log.md`
- Commit: `"Cleaned vitals dataset, simulated noise, added clinical features"`
