# Week 1 â€“ Day 4 Log

## âœ… Tasks Completed
- Visualized distributions of vitals
- Compared Heart Rate across Risk Categories
- Plotted BMI vs Age with color-coded Risk Labels
- Generated a full correlation heatmap for all numeric features

## ðŸ§  Learnings
- Distribution plots help detect outliers and skew
- Boxplots show how vitals vary with risk levels
- BMI and Age trends give useful clinical clues
- Heatmaps show which features might be redundant or predictive

## ðŸ“… GitHub Activity
- Added: `eda_vitals.py`, all plot images, `log.md`
- Commit: `"Performed EDA on vitals data with plots and correlations"`
