## ðŸ§  SHAP Interpretability Summary

- **Calculated_BMI** and **Heart Rate** are the most influential features in predicting high-risk patients.
- **Low Oxygen Saturation** values strongly contribute to a High Risk classification.
- **MAP (Mean Arterial Pressure)** also plays a meaningful role, while blood pressure and respiratory rate have minimal effect.
- SHAP values confirm medical expectations: low SpO2 and high HR are signs of potential patient deterioration.
