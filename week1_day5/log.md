# Week 1 â€“ Day 5 Log

## âœ… Tasks Completed
- Selected key vitals as features for modeling
- Encoded target labels (High Risk = 1, Low Risk = 0)
- Trained a Random Forest classifier on patient data
- Evaluated model performance using classification report
- Saved the trained model as `risk_predictor_model.pkl`

## ðŸ§  Learnings
- How to prepare healthcare tabular data for ML
- First-hand experience with classification metrics
- Importance of precision and recall in healthcare (false negatives can be deadly)
- How to export and save ML models for reuse

## ðŸ“… GitHub Activity
- Added: `train_risk_model.py`, model file, log
- Commit: `"Trained first model to classify patient risk category"`
