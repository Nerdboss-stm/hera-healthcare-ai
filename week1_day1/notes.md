# Day 1 Notes

1. What kind of data is used in healthcare AI?
Healthcare AI uses a mix of structured (like vitals, lab test results, medication records) and unstructured data (like clinical notes, radiology reports). It also includes time-series data (e.g., heart rate every 10 minutes), images (like CT scans), and sometimes genomic data.

2. What is Sepsis and why is early prediction important?
Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by the bodyâ€™s extreme response to an infection. It can lead to tissue damage, organ failure, or death. Early prediction can save lives by alerting doctors before symptoms become critical, giving them time to treat the patient.

3. What is this project trying to solve?
This project aims to build a real-time AI system that monitors patient health data, predicts life-threatening risks like Sepsis, explains those predictions using natural language, and gives doctors an intelligent assistant to help them make better, faster decisions.
